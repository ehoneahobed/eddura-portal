# Scholarship Template System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Empty Scholarship Field on Edit
**Problem**: When editing an application template, the scholarship field appeared empty even though a scholarship was linked to the template.

**Root Cause**: The `SearchableScholarshipSelect` component was only looking for the selected scholarship in the current search results, but when editing a template, the linked scholarship might not be in the current paginated results.

**Solution**: 
- Added `useScholarship` hook to fetch the specific scholarship when a value is provided
- Modified the selected scholarship finding logic to fall back to the specifically fetched scholarship if not found in current results
- Added loading state for when the specific scholarship is being fetched
- Fixed form state management to properly watch the `scholarshipId` field

**Files Modified**:
- `components/ui/searchable-scholarship-select.tsx`: Added specific scholarship fetching logic
- `components/forms/ApplicationTemplateForm.tsx`: Fixed form state handling for scholarship field

### 2. Limited Search Results 
**Problem**: When searching for scholarships (e.g., "Mastercard"), only 3 results were shown even though more matching scholarships exist.

**Root Cause**: 
- API default limit was too low (12 scholarships)
- Search was only looking at limited fields (title, provider, eligibility.degreeLevels)
- No comprehensive search across all relevant scholarship fields

**Solution**:
- Increased default API limit from 12 to 50 scholarships
- Enhanced search to include additional fields:
  - `scholarshipDetails` (scholarship description)
  - `eligibility.fieldsOfStudy` (fields of study)
  - `linkedSchool` (associated school)
  - `linkedProgram` (associated program)
  - `coverage` (coverage types)
  - `tags` (scholarship tags)
- Improved search placeholder text to reflect expanded search capabilities
- Added better sorting (alphabetical when searching, newest first otherwise)

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/scholarships/route.ts`: Enhanced search query and increased default limit
- `components/ui/searchable-scholarship-select.tsx`: Updated limit and search placeholder

### 3. Missing Scholarship Display on Template View
**Problem**: The template details page didn't show which scholarship the template was linked to.

**Root Cause**: The template view page was not fetching or displaying the scholarship information despite having the `scholarshipId` field.

**Solution**:
- Added `useScholarship` hook to fetch scholarship details based on template's `scholarshipId`
- Created new "Linked Scholarship" card section showing:
  - Scholarship title and provider
  - Scholarship value and frequency
  - Application deadline
  - Coverage types (with badges)
  - Link to scholarship details
- Added loading state for scholarship data
- Enhanced page title to include scholarship name when available

**Files Modified**:
- `app/admin/application-templates/[id]/page.tsx`: Added scholarship display section

## Additional Improvements

### Form Validation
- Added validation to ensure scholarship is selected when `allowScholarshipChange` is true
- Added error display for scholarship field validation
- Improved form validation feedback

### User Experience
- Added loading states for scholarship fetching
- Improved search experience with better placeholder text
- Enhanced visual feedback for scholarship selection
- Added proper error handling for scholarship loading failures

### Performance
- Increased pagination limits to reduce need for "Load More" clicks
- Optimized search queries with better field targeting
- Added proper caching with SWR for scholarship data

## Technical Details

### API Changes
```typescript
// Before
const limit = parseInt(searchParams.get('limit') || '12');
filter.$or = [
  { title: { $regex: search, $options: 'i' } },
  { provider: { $regex: search, $options: 'i' } },
  { 'eligibility.degreeLevels': { $regex: search, $options: 'i' } }
];

// After
const limit = parseInt(searchParams.get('limit') || '50');
filter.$or = [
  { title: { $regex: search, $options: 'i' } },
  { provider: { $regex: search, $options: 'i' } },
  { scholarshipDetails: { $regex: search, $options: 'i' } },
  { 'eligibility.degreeLevels': { $regex: search, $options: 'i' } },
  { 'eligibility.fieldsOfStudy': { $regex: search, $options: 'i' } },
  { linkedSchool: { $regex: search, $options: 'i' } },
  { linkedProgram: { $regex: search, $options: 'i' } },
  { coverage: { $regex: search, $options: 'i' } },
  { tags: { $regex: search, $options: 'i' } }
];
```

### Component Changes
```typescript
// Before
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (value && scholarships.length > 0) {
    const found = scholarships.find((s: Scholarship) => s.id === value);
    if (found) {
      setSelectedScholarship(found);
    }
  }
}, [value, scholarships]);

// After
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (value) {
    const found = scholarships.find((s: Scholarship) => s.id === value);
    if (found) {
      setSelectedScholarship(found);
    } else if (specificScholarship) {
      setSelectedScholarship(specificScholarship);
    }
  } else {
    setSelectedScholarship(null);
  }
}, [value, scholarships, specificScholarship]);
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Search Functionality**: Test searching for "Mastercard" and similar terms to verify more results are returned
2. **Template Editing**: Create a template with a scholarship, save it, then edit it to verify the scholarship field is populated
3. **Template Viewing**: View a template to verify the scholarship information is displayed correctly
4. **Form Validation**: Try to submit a template without selecting a scholarship to verify validation works
5. **Loading States**: Test on slow connections to verify loading states work properly

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Search**: Add more sophisticated search with filters by deadline, value range, etc.
2. **Scholarship Caching**: Implement better caching strategies for frequently accessed scholarships
3. **Bulk Operations**: Add ability to link multiple scholarships to a template
4. **Search Analytics**: Track which scholarships are most commonly searched for
5. **Fuzzy Search**: Implement fuzzy matching for better search experience

## Summary

These fixes address all three reported issues:
- ✅ Scholarship field now properly displays the linked scholarship when editing templates
- ✅ Search now returns comprehensive results across all relevant scholarship fields
- ✅ Template view page now displays complete scholarship information

The changes improve both functionality and user experience while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code.
