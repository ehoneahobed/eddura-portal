# Document Management System

## Overview

The Document Management System provides students with a comprehensive platform to create, organize, and version control their documents. This system addresses the key concerns about versioning, field explanations, and content length limitations.

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Versioning System

**How Versioning Works:**
- **Initial Creation**: When you create a document, it automatically gets version `v1`
- **Version Increment**: Each new document with the same title gets an incremented version number
- **Manual Versioning**: You can create new versions manually when editing documents
- **Version Display**: All documents show their version number (e.g., "v1", "v2", "v3")

**When Versions Change:**
- **New Document**: Creating a document with a title that already exists creates a new version
- **Manual Version Creation**: Using the "Create New Version" option when editing
- **Version History**: All versions are preserved and can be accessed

**Example:**
```
Personal Statement v1 (created on Jan 15)
Personal Statement v2 (created on Jan 20)
Personal Statement v3 (created on Jan 25)
```

### 2. Comprehensive Field Explanations

**Tooltips on Every Field:**
- Hover over the help icon (?) next to each field for instant explanations
- Tooltips provide clear, concise guidance on what each field is for

**Help Modal:**
- Click "Field Help" button to open a comprehensive help modal
- Detailed explanations for all fields in one place
- Organized by field categories for easy reference

**Field Explanations Include:**

| Field | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| **Title** | Give your document a clear, descriptive title that will help you identify it later. |
| **Description** | Optional brief description of what this document contains or its purpose. |
| **Content** | The main content of your document. You can write as much as you need - there are no character limits. |
| **Type** | Select the type that best describes your document. This helps with organization and search. |
| **Category** | Choose a category to group similar documents together. |
| **Tags** | Add relevant tags to make your document easier to find later. |
| **Language** | The primary language of your document content. |
| **Visibility** | If enabled, this document can be shared with others (when you choose to share it). |

### 3. Unlimited Content with Real-time Statistics

**No Character Limits:**
- Write as much content as you need
- No artificial restrictions on document length
- Content is stored efficiently in the database

**Real-time Statistics:**
- **Character Count**: Shows total characters as you type
- **Word Count**: Displays word count with smart word detection
- **Reading Time**: Estimated reading time (calculated automatically)
- **Last Edited**: Timestamp of last modification

**Visual Feedback:**
- Statistics update in real-time as you type
- Clean, unobtrusive display in the content area
- No performance impact from counting

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```typescript
interface IDocument {
  userId: mongoose.Types.ObjectId;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  content: string;
  type: 'cv' | 'resume' | 'personal_statement' | 'essay' | 'cover_letter' | 'recommendation' | 'transcript' | 'certificate' | 'other';
  category: 'academic' | 'professional' | 'personal' | 'certification' | 'other';
  tags: string[];
  version: number;
  isActive: boolean;
  isPublic: boolean;
  language: string;
  metadata: {
    wordCount: number;
    characterCount: number;
    readingTime?: number;
    lastEdited: Date;
  };
  permissions: {
    canEdit: boolean;
    canShare: boolean;
    canDelete: boolean;
  };
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/documents` - List documents with search/filter
- `POST /api/documents` - Create new document
- `GET /api/documents/[id]` - Get specific document
- `PUT /api/documents/[id]` - Update document or create new version
- `DELETE /api/documents/[id]` - Soft delete document

### Versioning Logic
```typescript
// Get next version number for a document
DocumentSchema.statics.getNextVersion = async function(userId: string, title: string): Promise<number> {
  const existingDoc = await this.findOne({ 
    userId, 
    title, 
    isActive: true 
  }).sort({ version: -1 });
  
  return existingDoc ? existingDoc.version + 1 : 1;
};

// Create new version
DocumentSchema.statics.createNewVersion = async function(userId: string, documentId: string, updates: Partial<IDocument>): Promise<IDocument> {
  const originalDoc = await this.findById(documentId);
  // Create new version with incremented version number
  const newVersion = new this({
    ...originalDoc.toObject(),
    _id: undefined,
    version: originalDoc.version + 1,
    ...updates
  });
  return await newVersion.save();
};
```
