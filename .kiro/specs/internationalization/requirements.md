# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements internationalization (i18n) support for the Eddura platform to serve users from francophone countries, particularly African countries that speak french. The platform will maintain English as the default language with all current URLs preserved, while adding French language support. The implementation should be extensible to support additional languages in the future.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user from a francophone country, I want to view the platform interface in French, so that I can better understand and navigate the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the platform THEN the system SHALL detect their browser language preference and display content in French if French is preferred and available
2. WHEN a user manually selects French from a language selector THEN the system SHALL switch the entire interface to French
3. WHEN French is selected THEN all static text, labels, buttons, navigation items, and form fields SHALL be displayed in French
4. WHEN French is selected THEN error messages and validation messages SHALL be displayed in French
5. IF a translation is missing THEN the system SHALL fall back to English text

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manually switch between English and French languages, so that I can choose my preferred language regardless of my browser settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page THEN the system SHALL display a language selector component
2. WHEN I click the language selector THEN the system SHALL show available language options (English and French)
3. WHEN I select a different language THEN the system SHALL immediately update the interface to the selected language
4. WHEN I select a language THEN the system SHALL remember my preference for future visits
5. WHEN I navigate to different pages THEN the system SHALL maintain my selected language preference

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the current English URLs to remain unchanged, so that existing bookmarks, SEO, and integrations continue to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing i18n THEN all existing English URLs SHALL remain functional and unchanged
2. WHEN a user accesses any existing URL THEN the system SHALL serve the content in the user's preferred language without changing the URL structure
3. WHEN search engines crawl the site THEN they SHALL find the same URL structure as before implementation
4. WHEN users share links THEN the URLs SHALL remain in English format regardless of the interface language

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to manage translations efficiently, so that I can easily add, update, and maintain French translations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new text to the application THEN developers SHALL use translation keys instead of hardcoded text
2. WHEN translation files are updated THEN the changes SHALL be reflected in the application without requiring code changes
3. WHEN a new feature is added THEN the system SHALL support both English and French translations from the start
4. WHEN viewing translation files THEN they SHALL be organized in a clear, hierarchical structure that matches the application structure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the i18n implementation to be performant and scalable, so that it doesn't negatively impact user experience or system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading pages THEN translation loading SHALL not cause noticeable delays
2. WHEN switching languages THEN the interface SHALL update smoothly without page reloads
3. WHEN adding new languages in the future THEN the system SHALL support them without major architectural changes
4. WHEN serving content THEN only the required language files SHALL be loaded to minimize bundle size
5. WHEN users visit the site THEN translations SHALL be cached appropriately to improve performance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want date, time, and number formats to be localized, so that they appear in formats familiar to my region.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing dates THEN they SHALL be formatted according to the selected language's regional conventions
2. WHEN viewing numbers THEN they SHALL use appropriate decimal separators and thousand separators for the selected language
3. WHEN viewing currency THEN it SHALL be displayed in the appropriate format for the selected language region
4. WHEN viewing time THEN it SHALL be formatted according to the selected language's conventions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the language switching functionality to be accessible, so that I can use it with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using a screen reader THEN the language selector SHALL be properly announced
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the language selector SHALL be reachable and operable via keyboard
3. WHEN language changes THEN screen readers SHALL be notified of the content language change
4. WHEN viewing the interface THEN all translated content SHALL maintain proper semantic structure for accessibility tools
