### 4. Vercel Cron Job Integration

#### Automated Reminder System

  - Marks overdue requests

#### Cron Job Features
- **Smart Reminder Logic**: Only sends reminders when appropriate
- **Error Handling**: Logs errors without failing the entire job
- **Status Updates**: Automatically marks requests as overdue
- **Detailed Logging**: Tracks all reminder activities

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Email Functions (`lib/email.ts`)

#### `sendRecommendationRequestEmail()`
```typescript
export const sendRecommendationRequestEmail = async (
  recipientEmail: string,
  recipientName: string,
  studentName: string,
  requestTitle: string,
  deadline: Date,
  secureToken: string,
  requestType: string,
  submissionMethod: string,
  communicationStyle: string,
  relationshipContext: string,
  institutionName?: string,
  schoolEmail?: string,
  schoolInstructions?: string,
  includeDraft: boolean = false,
  draftContent?: string,
  additionalContext?: string
): Promise<boolean>
```

#### `sendRecommendationReminderEmail()`
```typescript
export const sendRecommendationReminderEmail = async (
  recipientEmail: string,
  recipientName: string,
  studentName: string,
  requestTitle: string,
  deadline: Date,
  secureToken: string,
  daysUntilDeadline: number,
  requestType: string,
  submissionMethod: string,
  institutionName?: string,
  reminderNumber: number = 1
): Promise<boolean>
```

#### `sendRecommendationReceivedEmail()`
```typescript
export const sendRecommendationReceivedEmail = async (
  studentEmail: string,
  studentName: string,
  recipientName: string,
  requestTitle: string
): Promise<boolean>
```

### 2. Database Schema Updates

#### RecommendationRequest Model
```typescript
// New fields added
reminderFrequency: {
  type: String,
  enum: ['minimal', 'standard', 'aggressive', 'custom'],
  default: 'standard',
},
```

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Create Recommendation Request (`POST /api/recommendations/requests`)
- Sends initial email to recipient
- Updates request status to 'sent'
- Sets up reminder tracking

#### Cron Job (`GET /api/cron/recommendation-reminders`)
- Protected with authentication
- Processes pending reminders
- Updates request statuses

### 4. Frontend Enhancements

#### Reminder Frequency Selection
- Radio button options for reminder frequency
- Real-time preview of reminder schedule
- Automatic interval calculation

#### Form Validation
- Ensures all required fields are completed
- Validates deadline is in the future
- Checks recipient information

## Configuration
