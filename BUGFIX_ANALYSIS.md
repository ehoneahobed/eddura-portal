# School Page Bug Analysis & Fixes

## Issues Identified

### 1. Database Connection Issues
**Problem**: The MongoDB URI is set to a local instance that likely doesn't exist, causing API calls to fail.
**Impact**: School page crashes when trying to fetch data.
**Fix**: Set up proper MongoDB connection or use MongoDB Atlas.

### 2. Form Validation Issues
**Problem**: The SchoolForm component has potential issues with form validation and submission.
**Impact**: Users cannot add new schools successfully.
**Fix**: Improve form validation and error handling.

### 3. Missing Error Boundaries
**Problem**: React components don't have proper error boundaries to catch and display errors gracefully.
**Impact**: The entire page crashes instead of showing an error message.
**Fix**: Add error boundaries and improve error handling.

### 4. Type Safety Issues
**Problem**: Some components have type mismatches that could cause runtime errors.
**Impact**: Potential crashes when dealing with undefined or null values.
**Fix**: Add proper type checking and null handling.

### 5. SWR Error Handling
**Problem**: The useSchools hook doesn't properly handle all error states.
**Impact**: Loading states and error states are not properly managed.
**Fix**: Improve error handling in the SWR hook.
