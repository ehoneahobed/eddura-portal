# ✅ Application Templates 500 Error - FIXED

## Problem Identified
The recent commit (`c7bb964`) that "improved application templates API with pagination and error handling" **removed `.lean()`** from MongoDB queries, causing serialization issues in Vercel's serverless environment.

## Solution Applied
Added `.lean()` back to all MongoDB queries in:
- `app/api/application-templates/route.ts` (2 queries fixed)
- `app/api/application-templates/[id]/route.ts` (5 queries fixed)

## Why This Fixes It
`.lean()` returns plain JavaScript objects instead of Mongoose documents, which:
- ✅ Serialize properly in serverless environments
- ✅ Avoid circular reference issues
- ✅ Reduce memory usage and improve performance

## Test the Fix

### 1. Verify on Vercel
- Visit your deployed application on Vercel
- Navigate to the Application Templates page
- The 500 error should be resolved

### 2. Debug Endpoint (if needed)
If you still see issues, check: `/api/test-templates`
This endpoint was added for debugging and will show detailed error information.

### 3. Expected Behavior
- ✅ Application templates page loads without errors
- ✅ API returns templates with proper pagination
- ✅ No more "Failed to fetch application templates" errors

## Technical Details
**Before**: Mongoose documents → Serialization issues in serverless
**After**: Plain objects (`.lean()`) → Clean serialization ✅

## Deployment
The fix is ready for deployment. Push these changes to trigger a new Vercel deployment.
