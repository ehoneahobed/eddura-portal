# Application Buddies System - Comprehensive Implementation Guide

## Executive Summary

The Application Buddies system is a revolutionary social feature that transforms the solitary scholarship application process into a collaborative, supportive experience. This system addresses the fundamental need for peer accountability, quality feedback, and emotional support during the stressful application journey.

## üéØ Core Problem & Solution

### The Solution
- **Peer Accountability**: Regular check-ins and progress tracking
- **Quality Assurance**: Mutual review and feedback on applications
