Key Considerations for Implementation:
User Interface: Ensure a clean, intuitive, and mobile-friendly interface for the quiz. Progress indicators would be helpful.
AI Integration: The responses to these questions will form the core data for your AI. The AI will need to be trained on a vast dataset of university programs, career paths, and student profiles to make accurate and personalized recommendations.
Weighting: You might consider assigning different weights to certain categories or questions based on their perceived importance in career discovery (e.g., "Interest Areas" and "Career Goals" might have higher weights than "Location Preferences" for core program recommendations).
Feedback Mechanism: After providing recommendations, consider allowing users to provide feedback on the accuracy or helpfulness of the suggestions to further refine your AI.
Privacy: Clearly communicate how user data will be collected, stored, and used, emphasizing privacy and data security.
This comprehensive quiz structure should provide Eddura's AI with a rich dataset to generate highly personalized and relevant university program recommendations for its users. Good luck!
