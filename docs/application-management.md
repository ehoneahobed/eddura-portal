help me think through this. we are building eddura.com a scholarship and school seeking platform where we help students manage the end to end application processes. You can create or gather your documents at one place, manage deadlines, etc

for the scholarships listed on our website, we add application forms so you can fill it out but we are not affiliated or connected to any of the scholarships so you use our portal to help you prepare the documents and answer your questions before transferring to the main scholarship application portal.

When it comes to applying to schools or their programs, we don't have an application form for each (because that could be a lot). However, we want the students using the platform to be able to manage every other thing including tracking their documents (so all the required docs, getting feedback on the docs from people you share with, etc, keeping track of the deadlines, etc)

currently we have already implemented scholarships functionality where you can save a scholarship for later use (in saved scholarships), or start applying for a scholarship and start the application form for you to complete.

but we want to take this a step further and ensure that we have covered the entire end to end process of program or scholarship application. Some times a student wants to apply for a scholarship in addition to a school program or as a standalone and should be able to link a school application to a scholarship application if they wanted. they could also apply to multiple scholarships for the same school. Also, there are some scholarships that you can apply to for multiple schools.

or they can apply to a school without applying for a scholarship. or apply for a scholarship without applying for a school. there are some institutions that you apply to the scholarship first before the school. YOu only apply to the school once the scholarship has given you the go ahead. Then there are some schools that you only apply to the scholarship after the school has given you an offer. There are some schools that you do both separately but you only get the scholarship only when the school makes you. And several other options too.

We want to make a robust application management feature that streamlines all these for the user in one place.

The journey usually starts with showing interests, then proceeding to create an application package through to when you get a final unconditional offer. Sometimes after the offer, you now have to look for scholarship.

Currently users may either use a book (that is what I used) or excel to document the schools or scholarships that they want to apply to.  Usually listing the things that they require (like number of recommendation letters, english proficiency, statement of purpose, whether there is interview, application fee, transcript evaluation, etc). So, they may have a long list of these schools/scholarships then eventually settle on the once to apply to or start applying one after the other or even starting multiple applications for them. They will keep track of the deadlines in order not to miss any of them. request for recommendation letters, request for feedback on any of the essays they have written, etc

With the current implementation of eddura.com, you can create any document or upload any document you want and they would be in your documents. These documents are made to be resuable so they are not strictly linked to any school or scholarship. You can also share the document you create on eddura.com for others to review it for you. we also have documents library where we list sample documents that users can clone and edit to use as their own.

can you help me think through this and how to implement the robust application management module:

- interview management
- deadline management
- status tracking (color coded -> eg: green when the entire application package is complete)
    - offer made (conditional, unconditional) - interview requested - school requested for clarificaition
- download application package as zip??
- should able to use this feature for schools or scholarships that are not listed on the platform


you need to create a markdown file and put down the plan in it. Also, I didn't see anywhere where we mentioned any of the application package (school or scholarship) that we create we will need to have a set list of required documents (like personal statement, english proficiency, recommendation letter, school official/unofficial transcript, evaluated transcript, application fee, etc) I believe we need have that in mind. we can auto build these requirements if they are already available from our scholarship and program models but also allow adding of new ones that we didn't add. but this will make it easy for user to track. for this application package, have I gotten all the requirements and be able to check them each at a time. some requirements are sometimes optional while others are required and we need to make room for all that. if I am adding an external application, I should be able to add the requriements, etc and even if it is one on our platform, I should be able to add to the requirements if that particular thing isn't already captured.

### Key Features to Implement:

1. **Application Tracking**:

   * **Application Phases**: Break the application process into clear phases (e.g., Interest, Preparation, Application, Interview, Offer, Decision). This helps users visualize where they are in the process and what needs to be done next.
   * **Progress Tracking**: Allow users to mark phases as "Complete" or "In Progress" with deadlines associated with each phase.
   * **Linking School & Scholarship**: Allow users to link a school application to a scholarship and vice versa, depending on the specific application process (e.g., scholarship first, school application after, or vice versa).
   * **Multiple Applications**: Enable the user to apply for multiple scholarships for the same school or apply for multiple schools with or without scholarships.
   * **Dynamic Application Forms**: Implement a feature to manage application forms that evolve depending on the user's inputs (e.g., school application with scholarship, or just school application).

2. **Document Management**:

   * **Reusable Documents**: Continue allowing users to create/upload reusable documents that can be used for any scholarship or school application.
   * **Document Linking to Applications**: Allow users to attach or link documents (e.g., Statement of Purpose, Recommendation Letters) to specific applications, whether they are for school or scholarship applications.

3. **Customizable Workflow**:

   * **School-Specific or scholarship-specific Workflows**: Different schools have different application processes. Implement custom workflows for each school that allows users to set application steps and requirements based on the institution’s specific guidelines (e.g., scholarship first, then application or application first, then scholarship).
   * **Custom Reminders**: Add customizable reminders for each document or task, so users are notified of deadlines related to documents (e.g., submitting recommendation letters) and application stages (e.g., interview dates).

4. **Communication & Collaboration**:

   * **Recommendation Letter Requests**: Allow users to send recommendation letter requests directly to potential recommenders via the platform and track the status (pending, completed, etc.).
   * **Collaborative Document Editing**: Enable collaborative editing on documents for real-time feedback and improvements, allowing multiple users to contribute.
   * **Automated Follow-Up**: Implement features to send automated reminders to recommendation letter writers or others involved in the application process when documents are overdue or when deadlines are approaching.

5. **Application Dashboard**:

   * **Centralized Overview**: Provide a central dashboard where users can view their entire application progress (for both school and scholarships) with deadlines, tasks, and statuses.
   * **Filter & Sort Applications**: Allow users to filter applications by status (e.g., "In Progress," "Completed," "Pending Review") and by type (school, scholarship).
   * **Application Analytics**: Allow users to see metrics such as how many applications they’ve started, submitted, and what stage they’re at, as well as how many scholarships or schools they’ve applied to.


This system should be flexible enough to support all the different types of applications students might want to make, while also offering a smooth, intuitive user experience.
