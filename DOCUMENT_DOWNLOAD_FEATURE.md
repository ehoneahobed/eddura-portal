## How to Use

```

### PDF Generation

## Security Features

- **Authentication Required**: All download endpoints require user authentication

- **Library Access**: Library documents are publicly accessible to authenticated users
- **Input Validation**: Format parameters are validated to prevent injection attacks

## Error Handling

- **Server Errors**: Returns 500 for internal server errors

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

3. **Large File Sizes**:
   - PDF files may be large for documents with many pages
   - Consider using DOCX format for editing purposes

4. **Formatting Issues**:
