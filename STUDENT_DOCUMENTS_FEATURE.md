}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Document Upload** - Support for uploading PDF, DOC, and other file formats
2. **Document Templates** - Pre-built templates for common document types
3. **Collaboration** - Allow sharing documents with mentors or advisors
4. **Export Options** - Export documents as PDF, DOC, or other formats
5. **Document Analytics** - Track document usage and effectiveness
6. **AI Assistance** - AI-powered writing suggestions and improvements
7. **Document Comparison** - Compare different versions of documents
8. **Bulk Operations** - Select and manage multiple documents at once

### Upload-based Documents

The following document types will support file uploads:

- Degree certificates
- Language proficiency certificates
- Other certificates

These will be implemented with:
- File upload interface
- File validation (type, size, security)

## Security Considerations

1. **User Isolation** - Users can only access their own documents
2. **Input Validation** - All user inputs are validated and sanitized
3. **Authentication Required** - All document operations require authentication
4. **Rate Limiting** - API endpoints are protected against abuse
5. **Data Encryption** - Sensitive document content is encrypted at rest

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Indexing** - Optimized indexes for common queries
2. **Pagination** - Large document lists are paginated
3. **Caching** - Document types and configurations are cached
4. **Lazy Loading** - Document content is loaded on demand
5. **Efficient Queries** - Optimized database queries with proper projections

## Error Handling

The feature includes comprehensive error handling:
- Validation errors with user-friendly messages
- Network error handling with retry mechanisms
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Proper error logging for debugging

## Testing

The feature should be tested for:
- Unit tests for all components and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for user workflows
- Performance tests for large document sets
- Security tests for access control

## Deployment Notes

1. **Database Migration** - Ensure the Document model is properly migrated
2. **Environment Variables** - Configure any required environment variables
3. **File Storage** - Set up cloud storage for future upload functionality
4. **Monitoring** - Set up monitoring for document-related operations
5. **Backup Strategy** - Implement backup strategy for document data
