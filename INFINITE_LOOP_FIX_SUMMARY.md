# Infinite Loop Fix Summary

## Problem
The `/library` and `/documents/cloned` pages were experiencing continuous loading loops where the loader would spin indefinitely without loading any content. This was happening due to improper dependency management in React's `useEffect` hooks.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by circular dependencies in the `useEffect` hooks:

1. **Library Page**: The `fetchDocuments` function was included in the dependency arrays of multiple `useEffect` hooks
2. **Cloned Documents Page**: The `fetchClonedDocuments` function was included in the dependency arrays of multiple `useEffect` hooks
3. These functions themselves had dependencies that changed frequently, creating an infinite loop

### Original Problematic Code Pattern:
```typescript
const fetchDocuments = useCallback(async (page = 1, limit = pagination.limit) => {
  // ... fetch logic
}, [session?.user?.id, searchTerm, categoryFilter, typeFilter, targetAudienceFilter, sortBy, pagination]);

// This created infinite loops because fetchDocuments was in the dependency array
useEffect(() => {
  if (session?.user?.id) {
    fetchDocuments();
  }
}, [session?.user?.id, fetchDocuments]); // ‚ùå fetchDocuments causes re-renders
```

## Solution

### 1. Created Custom Hook (`useDataFetching`)
Created a robust custom hook that properly manages data fetching with:
- Proper dependency management
- Built-in debouncing
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Memory leak prevention

```typescript
export function useDataFetching<T>({
  fetchFunction,
  dependencies = [],
  immediate = true,
  debounceMs = 0
}: UseDataFetchingOptions<T>) {
  // ... implementation
}
```

### 2. Refactored Library Page
- Removed the problematic `useEffect` hooks with circular dependencies
- Integrated the custom `useDataFetching` hook
- Simplified state management
- Added proper error handling with toast notifications

### 3. Refactored Cloned Documents Page
- Applied the same pattern as the library page
- Removed circular dependencies
- Used the custom hook for data fetching
- Added proper error handling

### 4. Updated Function Calls
- Changed `fetchDocuments()` calls to `refetch()`
- Updated clone and rating functions to use `refetch()` instead of manual state updates
- Maintained all existing functionality while fixing the loop issue

## Key Changes Made

### Library Page (`app/(user-portal)/library/page.tsx`)
1. **Removed problematic useEffect hooks** that had circular dependencies
2. **Integrated useDataFetching hook** with proper dependencies
3. **Updated function calls** to use `refetch()` instead of direct function calls
4. **Added error handling** with toast notifications

### Cloned Documents Page (`app/(user-portal)/documents/cloned/page.tsx`)
1. **Applied the same pattern** as the library page
2. **Removed circular dependencies** in useEffect hooks
3. **Used custom hook** for data fetching
4. **Updated delete functionality** to use `refetch()`

### Custom Hook (`hooks/useDataFetching.ts`)
1. **Proper dependency management** - no circular dependencies
2. **Built-in debouncing** - prevents excessive API calls
3. **Error handling** - catches and reports errors properly
4. **Memory leak prevention** - cleans up timeouts and prevents updates on unmounted components
5. **Loading states** - proper loading state management

## Benefits of the Solution

1. **Eliminates Infinite Loops**: The custom hook properly manages dependencies without creating circular references
2. **Better Performance**: Built-in debouncing prevents excessive API calls
3. **Improved Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with toast notifications
4. **Memory Leak Prevention**: Proper cleanup of timeouts and prevents updates on unmounted components
5. **Reusable**: The custom hook can be used across the application for consistent data fetching patterns
6. **Maintainable**: Cleaner code structure with separation of concerns

## Testing

The solution includes comprehensive tests (`hooks/useDataFetching.test.ts`) that verify:
- Data fetching on mount
- Debouncing functionality
- Error handling
- Prevention of infinite loops
- Proper cleanup

## Files Modified

1. `app/(user-portal)/library/page.tsx` - Refactored to use custom hook
2. `app/(user-portal)/documents/cloned/page.tsx` - Refactored to use custom hook
3. `hooks/useDataFetching.ts` - New custom hook for data fetching
4. `hooks/useDataFetching.test.ts` - Tests for the custom hook

## Prevention of Future Issues

1. **Custom Hook Pattern**: Using the custom hook prevents similar issues in other parts of the application
2. **Dependency Management**: The hook properly manages dependencies without creating circular references
3. **Documentation**: Clear documentation of the pattern for future developers
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive tests ensure the solution works correctly

This solution provides a robust, scalable approach to data fetching that prevents infinite loops while maintaining all existing functionality.
